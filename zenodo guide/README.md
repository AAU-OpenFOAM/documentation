# What is Zenodo?
Zenodo is a platform to share software and raw data among others in a more official way. Once the software has been uploaded to Zenodo a landing page with a DOI is created. Using this landing page, you can name the author(s) of the software, give a short description of the software. The software is automatically linked to the Github account. Using the DOI link other people can easily refer to your work. If someone adds something to the code in a later stage, you can create a new release of the software on Github and create a new version of the software on Zenodo, thereby only adding the new authors to the newly created version.
